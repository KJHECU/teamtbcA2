// Project Background

This file supports Assignment 2 for the Mobile Applications Development unit CSP2108.2018 at ECU (Semester 2 - 2018)

The project involved the development of a mobile application based on requirements set by a client team, 
consisting of students from another ECU unit. The requirements were gathered during the preceding assignment 1

The application targets overseas Australians and intends to provide assistance in both determining and supporting 
ones legal rights whilst in other countries, it does this through a number of features including - simple but static 
phrase translation and contact details for local lawyers.

// Dependencies

(1) The application has been developed in LUA using the Corona SDK simulated environment and is recommended for installation 
(to a local desktop) for running the source code of the app. The Corona SDK simulator is available for free download 
from https://coronalabs.com/

(2) The application uses SQlite database to store a number of varying data elements/tables. This data is stored in a .db file, 
to administer said database (locally in a test environment) we recommend using DB Browser for sql lite available for 
free download from https://sqlitebrowser.org/. Once installed the db file (located in the source code discussed further within) 
can be administered at an administrative level for testing purposes.

(3) The source code for the application is currently housed within the GITHUB repository available 
through: https://github.com/KJHECU/teamtbcA2. To make for seemless testing (in a local environment with version control 
syncing back to the online repository), it is recommended that the desktop version of GITHUB be installed locally 
and is available free at https://desktop.github.com/

In Summary:
- Download and Install Corona SDK simulator
- Download and Install SB Browser for SQL lite
- Download and Install Desktop GITHUB

// Opening and Running source code

1. Configure the online repository KJHECU/teamtbcA2 through GITHUB desktop
2. Fetch the code from master branch (retrieves the code from the overarching branch in the online repository)
3. Open the Corona SDK simulator and select to Open a project, and
4. In the Corona SDK simulator, navigate through the local directory to the location GITHUB was 
installed open the directory and select the main.lua file
5. To access the application in the simulated environment use
   User: a Password: a for admin test purposes
   User: User@user.com Password: user for general user purposes OR create and register an account (general user)

Alternatively (using the source code provided in the BlackBoard submission)

1. Download the KJHECU/teamtbcA2 folder to the local device
2. Open the Corona SDK simulator and select to Open a project, and
3. In the Corona SDK simulator, navigate through the local directory to the KJHECU/teamtbcA2 folder was 
installed open the directory and select the main.lua file
4. To access the application in the simulated environment use
   User: a Password: a for admin test purposes
   User: User@user.com Password: user for general user purposes OR create and register an account (general user)
